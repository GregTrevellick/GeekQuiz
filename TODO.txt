BUG can select multiple radio buttons and submit !


Why ?
Just an ordinary coder, 9-5 job at a firm, not silicon valley, not contractor, not MVP.
We get so much free stuff - utube videos, channel9 videos, jquery, chart.js, newtonsoft, etc).
IT career has served me well, so I want to give something back.
No deep or complex questions, designed for quick so as to not interrupt your day. Not for certification or for job interviews, just fun. 
Bonus: I can learn things I couldn't learn in day job (git, nuget, restsharp, markdown, .net 4.7, chrome extensions (angular, chart.js)).
