A just-for-fun [CharityWare][CharityWareURL] extension that poses a music quiz question when opening the Start Page

- Configurable to also or only pose questions when opening and/or closing a solution

- In no way official nor for certification or job interviews, but are hopefully educational

- If you like this ***free*** extension, please give it a [review][VSMarketplaceUrl]

- Inspired by [Phil Haack's Encourage](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Haacked.Encourage) extension

- Arguably pointless, arguably helpful, definitely arbitrary
